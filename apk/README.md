# APK Building Instructions for Freevia

This folder is where your APK files will be placed after building.

## Current Status
✅ Python 3.13 installed and configured
✅ All required libraries installed (Kivy 2.3.1, Pillow, Plyer, etc.)
✅ buildozer.spec configured for APK building
✅ GitHub Actions workflow ready for cloud builds

## Windows Limitation
❌ Buildozer cannot build Android APKs directly on Windows

## Available Solutions:

### 1. GitHub Actions (Recommended - Already Working!)
- Push your code to GitHub
- APK builds automatically in the cloud
- Download APK from Actions artifacts
- **This is your easiest option!**

### 2. WSL2 Installation (For Local Building)
Run in PowerShell as Administrator:
```powershell
wsl --install Ubuntu
```
Then follow instructions in `wsl2_setup.sh`

### 3. Docker Approach
Install Docker Desktop and follow `docker_build.md`

### 4. Manual Copy from GitHub Actions
When GitHub Actions builds complete, the APK will be available as an artifact. 
Download it and place it in this folder.

## Next Steps:
1. **Recommended**: Use GitHub Actions by pushing your code
2. **For local builds**: Install WSL2 or Docker
3. **Generated APKs**: Will appear in this folder once built

## APK Location:
- Built APKs will be saved here: `apk/`
- GitHub Actions artifacts can be downloaded and placed here
- WSL2/Docker builds can be copied here after building
